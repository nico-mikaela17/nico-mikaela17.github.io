        <h4>Harry Styles</h4>
        <figure class="harry"><img src="images/harry.jpg" alt="Harry Styles"></figure>
        <p>Styles, the youngest member of One Direction, became a fan favorite for his curly hair, wide smile and sweet-yet-naughty demeanor. He sang some of the lead vocals on the band's first single, "What Makes You Beautiful," which was released in September 2011 in the United Kingdom. One Direction's debut album, Up All Night, was a best seller in both the United Kingdom and the United States the following year. In another highlight of 2012, Styles and the rest of One Direction performed at the Olympics closing ceremony in London. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/harry-styles"> Learn More </a></p>

        <figure class="niall"><img src="images/niall.jpg" alt="Niall Horan"></figure>
        <p>In 2010, when he was 16 years old, Horan auditioned for the television talent competition The X Factor. He moved through several rounds of preliminary auditions, culminating in a performance for the program's judges, including Simon Cowell and guest judge Katy Perry, in Dublin. He sang a version of Ne-Yo's "So Sick" and was accepted into the official competition. Although he was eliminated as a solo contestant after the semifinals, the judges combined Horan with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson to form the boy band One Direction. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/niall-horan"> Learn More </a></p>

        <h4>Louis Tomlinson</h4>
        <figure class="louis"><img src="images/louis.jpg" alt="Louis Tomlinson"></figure>
        <p>Tomlinson auditioned for the television talent competition The X Factor in 2009 but was turned down. However, when he returned to try out for the show's seventh season in 2010, his rendition of the song "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's brought him successfully into the competition. He advanced several rounds, singing hits like Adele's "Make You Feel My Love." He was eliminated before the final round, but the judges united him with his fellow competitors Styles, Horan, Payne and Malik to form a group act. This new band, called One Direction, finished the competition in third place and received a contract with Simon Cowell's music label. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/louis-tomlinson"> Learn More </a></p>

        <h4>Liam Payne</h4>
        <figure class="liam"><img src="images/liam.jpg" alt="Liam Payne"></figure>
        <p>Payne returned to the show in 2010 for the seventh series, auditioning in front of Cowell, Cole, Walsh and guest judge Natalie Imbruglia. He sang the Michael Bubl√© version of "Cry Me a River", which earned him four yeses and a standing ovation from Cowell. Payne was considered the second favourite to win the competition following his solo audition. He failed to progress to the "Boys" category at judges' houses, but after a suggestion by guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, Payne, along with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik, were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, during the bootcamp stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the "Groups" category.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Payne#2008%E2%80%932015:_The_X-Factor_and_One_Direction"> Learn More </a></p>
